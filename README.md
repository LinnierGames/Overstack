<h3 id="1">Saving data from fields in my form and retrieving them by listing out the main key in my main viewcontroller? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31576023/saving-data-from-fields-in-my-form-and-retrieving-them-by-listing-out-the-main-k">Q&A</a> - @<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/5038320/silv">silv</a></h3>
<small>I'm learning iOS at school but can't seem to get my head around the coding.. Which is what I need to do for my final project. Thus I would like to seek your kind help and guidance here...I kind of grasped the concept of how I would like my app to go, and how to create the GUI(probably) but would need advice on the coding for it and the data persistency. Say my main viewcontroller is a tableview which is empty at first, but if I click on the add button, it will direct me to a form where you can fill in a person's name and say maybe their score. Then when you save and go back to the main view, the person's name is listed out. You can add more persons or edit a person by tapping on the name(it will return you back to the form where you can edit the score etc).

Thanks in advance! (I did revise my notes many times but I still couldn't get it >_<)</small>

<small>I have put a UIPickerView for the user to select how they are feeling; annoyed, happy, sad etc. However I cannot convert what they have selected to a string or text. Is it possible to do this? If not how can I save the row/option they have selected in the picker?</small>
